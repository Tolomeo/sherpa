      Every path in Sherpa could vary slightly depending on the differences
      among subjects and on their resources being designed by different authors,
      in different times and with different objectives in mind.
      <br />
      There are some recurring patterns nonetheless.
    </Typography>
    <Typography>
      First of all, and if possible, paths will start with a{' '}
      <b>You want to come from</b> section, listing any other preparatory path.
    </Typography>
    <Typography>
      The path itself is a list of resources, ordered in such a way to cover all
      topic’s essentials, from beginner to intermediate/advanced level.
